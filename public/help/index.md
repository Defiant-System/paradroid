## Gameplay
Clear the Freighter of robots by destroying them with weapon or by hacking them - consequently gain control over them.


### Influence Device
The **001 Influence Device** consists of an anti-grav lightweight symbiont, which can latch on any robot's control
unit and halt the normal activities of that robot for a short time. The symbiont has its own energy suply and 
powers the robot itself, at an upgraded capability. The symbiont also uses an energy cloak for protection of the host.

The symbiont is fitted with a basic laser mounted in a turret. It can be focused on any target inside a range
of eight metres. Most of the device's sources are channeled towards holding control of the host robot, as it 
attempts to resume 'normal' operation.

It is therefore necessary to change the device from burning out. **Transfer** to a new robot requires the device to
drain its host of energy in order to take over. Failure to achieve transfer results in the device being a 
free agent once more.


### Robo-Freighters
A fleet of Robo-Freighters on its way to the Beta Ceti system reported entering an uncharted field of asteroids.
Each ship carries a cargo of battle droids to reinforce the outworld defences.

Two distress beacons have been recoverered. Similar messages were stored on each. The ships had been bombarded 
by powerful radionic beam from one of the asteroids.
All of the robots on the ships, including those in storage, became hyper-active. The crews report an attack by droids.
Isonlating them on the bridge. They cannot reach the shuttle and can hold out for only a couple more hours.

Since these beacons were located two days ago, we can only fear the worst.
Some of the fleet was last seen heading for enemy space. In enemy hands the droids can be used against our forces.
Docking would be impossible but we can beam aboard a prototype Influence Device.


### Interface
An Influence Device can transmit only certain data, namely its own location and the location of other robots 
in visual range. This data is merged with known ship layouts at your computers remote terminal.

Additional information about the ship and robots may be obtained by accessing the ships computer at a console.
A small-scale plan of the whole deck is available, as well as a side elevation of the ship.
Robots are represented on-screen as a symbol showing a three-digit number. The first digit shown is the 
important one, the class of the robot. It denotes the strength also.

To find out more about any given robot, use the robot enquiry system at a console. Only data about units of 
lower class than your current host is available, since it is the host's security clearance which is used to access the console.
